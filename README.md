# Car Resale Price Prediction

## 🚗 Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the resale price of used cars. The model helps both buyers and sellers to estimate fair market values based on various car attributes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Techniques Implemented
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, encoding categorical data)  
- Feature Engineering  
- Regression Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Model Evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about used cars with features including:
- Brand  
- Model  
- Year  
- Fuel Type  
- Transmission  
- Number of Seats  
- Kilometers Driven  
- Owner Type  
- And more

## 🔍 Project Steps

1. **Data Collection & Loading:**  
   Loaded the used car dataset and examined its structure.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and visualized insights.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**  
   Handled missing values, detected and treated outliers, and encoded categorical variables.

4. **Feature Engineering:**  
   Created and selected important features for better model performance.

5. **Model Building:**  
   Implemented Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.

6. **Model Evaluation:**  
   Compared models using R² score and Mean Squared Error to choose the best predictor.

## 📈 Results
- The Polynomial Regression model gave the best performance with a high R² score and low Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- This model can reliably predict resale prices based on car attributes, outperforming other regression models tested.


## 🤝 Contribution
This project demonstrates the practical application of regression techniques in the automobile domain and helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
